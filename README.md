# UFRJ Projects
My personal projects from the bachelor's degree courses in Computer Science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

## Concurrent Computing
Scripts and small programs that leverage concurrent programming techniques to improve performance and scalability.

## RSA Python
An implementation of the RSA cryptosystem in Python. It uses concepts such as modular arithmetic, primes and coprimes numbers, Millerâ€“Rabin primality test, etc.
